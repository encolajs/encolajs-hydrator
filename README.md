EncolaJS Hydrator is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides powerful type casting, object hydration, and serialization capabilities. It bridges the gap between plain JavaScript objects and complex class instances, making it ideal for 
working with API responses, form data, or any scenario where you need to transform data between different formats and structures.

## Core Features

- **Type Casting**: Convert values to specific types with built-in or custom casters
- **Object Hydration**: Transform plain objects into typed class instances
- **Serialization**: Convert complex objects back to plain JSON
- **Model Building**: Create model classes with built-in functionality
- **Collection Management**: Work with arrays of model instances through a powerful API
